H\+Elib is an open-\/source (\href{http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0}{\texttt{ Apache License v2.\+0}}) software library that implements homomorphic encryption (HE). Currently available schemes are the implementations of the \href{http://eprint.iacr.org/2011/277}{\texttt{ Brakerski-\/\+Gentry-\/\+Vaikuntanathan}} (B\+GV) scheme and the Approximate Number scheme of \href{http://eprint.iacr.org/2016/421}{\texttt{ Cheon-\/\+Kim-\/\+Kim-\/\+Song}} (C\+K\+KS), along with many optimizations to make homomorphic evaluation runs faster, focusing mostly on effective use of the \href{http://eprint.iacr.org/2011/133}{\texttt{ Smart-\/\+Vercauteren}} ciphertext packing techniques and the \href{http://eprint.iacr.org/2012/099}{\texttt{ Gentry-\/\+Halevi-\/\+Smart}} optimizations.

Since mid-\/2018 H\+Elib has been under extensive refactoring for {\itshape Reliability}, {\itshape Robustness \& Serviceability}, {\itshape Performance}, and most importantly {\itshape Usability} for researchers and developers working on HE and its uses.

H\+Elib supports an {\bfseries{\char`\"{}assembly language for H\+E\char`\"{}}}, providing low-\/level routines (set, add, multiply, shift, etc.), sophisticated automatic noise management, improved B\+GV bootstrapping, multi-\/threading, and also support for Ptxt (plaintext) objects which mimics the functionality of Ctxt (ciphertext) objects. See \href{https://github.com/homenc/HElib/changes.md}{\texttt{ changes.\+md}} for more details.

H\+Elib is written in C++14 and uses the \href{http://www.shoup.net/ntl/}{\texttt{ N\+TL}} mathematical library.
