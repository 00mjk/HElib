To build and run the new tests, one must pass {\ttfamily -\/D\+E\+N\+A\+B\+L\+E\+\_\+\+T\+E\+ST=on} to cmake -\/ see \mbox{\hyperlink{md___users__projects__f_h_e__h_elib__repos__public_staging_homenc__h_elib__i_n_s_t_a_l_l}{I\+N\+S\+T\+A\+LL.md}}. The google test library will then be downloaded and the correct targets will be defined for cmake. 2. To compile them, {\ttfamily make} as normal from a build directory. 3. The entire set of tests can be run with {\ttfamily ./bin/run\+Tests}. The parameters {\ttfamily no\+Print}, {\ttfamily dry} and {\ttfamily verbose} can be specified as before, but they will apply to all tests which are run. One can also run {\ttfamily make test}, which will run the tests through {\ttfamily ctest}, but the output will be significantly less verbose and therefore less helpful in the case of a failure.\hypertarget{md___users__projects__f_h_e__h_elib__repos__public_staging_homenc__h_elib__t_e_s_t_s_autotoc_md28}{}\doxysection{Running a subset of the tests One may often want to run a specific test or}\label{md___users__projects__f_h_e__h_elib__repos__public_staging_homenc__h_elib__t_e_s_t_s_autotoc_md28}
set of tests. This is achieved using google test\textquotesingle{}s built-\/in \textquotesingle{}filtering\textquotesingle{} system. To run only the {\ttfamily Poly\+Eval} tests, for example, one simply runs 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{./bin/runTests -\/-\/gtest\_filter='*PolyEval*'}
\end{DoxyCode}


More details on this filtering can be found in Google\textquotesingle{}s documentation \href{https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googletest/docs/advanced.md\#running-a-subset-of-the-tests}{\texttt{ here}}.\hypertarget{md___users__projects__f_h_e__h_elib__repos__public_staging_homenc__h_elib__t_e_s_t_s_autotoc_md29}{}\doxysection{Changing parameters The majority of the tests currently residing in}\label{md___users__projects__f_h_e__h_elib__repos__public_staging_homenc__h_elib__t_e_s_t_s_autotoc_md29}
{\ttfamily src/tests} are ported from the old tests which took several parameters. This maps reasonably well onto google test\textquotesingle{}s \textquotesingle{}Parameterised tests\textquotesingle{}, more of which can be read about \href{https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googletest/docs/advanced.md\#value-parameterized-tests}{\texttt{ here}}.

Currently, the parameters to run tests with are written in the tests themselves, and require modification in the code to run with different parameters. Some runtime overriding of these parameters would be possible by placing a function call in the {\ttfamily I\+N\+S\+T\+A\+N\+T\+I\+A\+T\+E\+\_\+\+T\+E\+S\+T\+\_\+\+C\+A\+S\+E\+\_\+P} macro, but this has not been done yet.\hypertarget{md___users__projects__f_h_e__h_elib__repos__public_staging_homenc__h_elib__t_e_s_t_s_autotoc_md30}{}\doxysection{Writing new tests}\label{md___users__projects__f_h_e__h_elib__repos__public_staging_homenc__h_elib__t_e_s_t_s_autotoc_md30}

\item The presence of \textquotesingle{}fixtures\textquotesingle{}, which are classes to contain common set-\/up and teardown code. These are created by inheriting from {\ttfamily \+::testing\+::\+Test} or {\ttfamily \+::testing\+::\+Test\+With\+Param$<$T$>$}, and typically have a name such as {\ttfamily G\+Test\+\_\+extract\+Digits}.
\item A rich set of expectation/assertion macros, such as {\ttfamily E\+X\+P\+E\+C\+T\+\_\+\+EQ}, {\ttfamily E\+X\+P\+E\+C\+T\+\_\+\+GT}, and many more which can be read about \href{https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googletest/docs/primer.md}{\texttt{ here}}. A test will typically contain at least one of these, the result of which determines the success or failure of the test.
\item A convenient runner which provides utilities such as filtering, repeating, shuffling, and convenient, consistent printouts. This adds significant convenience when only some tests are failing, since a summary as printed at the end specifying which tests failed, with which parameters they failed, etc.

It may also be helpful to look at the existing examples of the above style of testing, which can be found in the {\ttfamily src/tests} folder.
