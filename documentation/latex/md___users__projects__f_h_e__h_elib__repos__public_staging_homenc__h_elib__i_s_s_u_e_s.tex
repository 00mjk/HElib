These issues listed below are known to be current and are expected to be addressed.

The function in Binary\+Arith {\ttfamily fifteen\+Or\+Less4\+Four} is known to not be currently thread safe. Therefore set N\+TL\textquotesingle{}s thread pool to 1 to avoid this issue. The function {\ttfamily N\+T\+L\+::\+Set\+Num\+Threads} can be used to set the number of threads in the pool and {\ttfamily N\+T\+L\+::\+Available\+Threads} gives the current available threads in the pool.
